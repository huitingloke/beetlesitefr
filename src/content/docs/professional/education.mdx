## singapore management university

### 2022-now

I'm currently studying BSc. Computing and Law at Singapore Management University! Since I take a liking to legal technology, I find this course interesting. I've also been fortunate enough to be able to have new experiences in the various CCAs offered, like Muay Thai, bouldering, and acapella! I hope to have many more enjoyable experiences here and to make fond memories. Also, study. Yes.

## acs international (singapore)

### ib: 2020-2021

The journey to attain my International Baccalaureate diploma was definitely not an easy one. I remember crying many tears and surviving sleepless nights, rushing assignments to meet my deadlines, and being constantly stressed about my CCAs and having many new experiences. But overall, God is good, I got 38 in total which allowed me to go to the University of my choice!

### igcse: 2016-2019

For the aforementioned years, I did the international equivalent of "O" Levels in this school. 

## pei hwa presbyterian primary school

### 2010-2015

I joined this school when I was 7! In here, I started my rhythmic gymnastics journey of 10 years and made some great friends along the way. Here, my love for electronics and coding was piqued during the computer lab lessons as well as the little robotic structures that we got to occassionally play around with. My love for writing and music also started around here, thanks to some of the most supportive teachers I have had.
