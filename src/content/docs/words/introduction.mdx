title: it's just words

## a small overview

I think I'm beginning to kick myself since I now realize what using a documentation template for a personal website entails. It's not that this doesn't feel personal anymore, though I can't deny this was a rather convenient solution to get words and pictures onto a screen. It's just that there's an inherent limitation involving the lack of flair that I can take advantage of. All I have now are words. And these, too, are a flawed medium.
