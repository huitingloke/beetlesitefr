## baby introduction

There's a lot of art that I make that are used as a kind of second-thought "asset". Although I did have a period where I would draw on my iPad for a year straight, I eventually realized that with the ability to produce my own *assets*, I would no longer need to put so much focus on improving but rather enjoying the journey of creation and how I could use them in my other areas of interest.

Yet that are some things that I am genuinely particularly proud of. Such work will be displayed here. Of course, it's not a comprehensive list of everything that I want to show off, but it does allow me to show the art I'm proud I made over time.

## motion capture

### the precursor

When I was around the age of 10 or 11, I had my first foray into the world of motion capture through a game called *Dance Central 3*, one of the XBox Kinect staples. My family didn't own a Kinect but one of my sister's best friends had one, so I remember trotting over to their house to play Kinectimals and DC on multiple ocassions. 

The characters were so charming to me, especially Glitch (the techno-dance boy). When I played Just Dance, it didn't have the same robotically motion-captured dance moves that I yearned for. I delved into more game-related motion capture upon finding out about this technology. *The Last Of Us*, *Detroit Become Human*, even *God Of War* (which I haven't played in its entirety, that's how passionate I am about this) -- they all had gorgeous work done on it and I loved it. So I wanted to recreate this form of art in Blender.

I started out trying some simple GUI motion capture open source software. And while it (somewhat) worked with one camera, it did not at all work when I had to triangulate the cameras for depth perception using two. So I scrapped that idea (also since I couldn't put it on the rig) and waited for a miracle to happen.

And it did.

### motion capture (rokoko)

The use of artificial intelligence somehow wiggled its way into the MoCap world, and startups were sprouting up left, right and center, all offering single camera, prerigged (with Blender plugins) self-capturable motions for the low, low price of nothing! I was thrilled. Immediately, I tested out two Orientation dances which I had learned prior, dumped the rigs into Blender, added some effects, and rendered it using Eevee for about an hour each.

### miku miku dance

As if what you saw wasn't enough, I have enjoyed Anime and Anime styled characters since I was young. I've also been aware of the programme called Miku Miku Dance ("MMD") from that time, as people would make adorable dances with these 3D animated girls with pigtails. When I realized that there was a plugin for Blender that would allow me to use `.pmx` files inside natively, I was so excited.

I have to give credit where it is due. If not for [*uuunyaa's mmd tools*](https://github.com/UuuNyaa/blender_mmd_uuunyaa_tools), with its spectacular lighting, easy material handling, automatic model rigging and weight allocation (or maybe that's from the actual model), I would have been stuck in the dirt, fumbling around forever. It was such an intuitive programme that allowed me to render in Eevee (yeah, it even set that environment up) with great results!

Of course, special thanks to the people who created the Motion Downloads and models. Honestly, all I did was provide a GPU but on the bright side, now I can say that I've finally seen Chongyun from *Genshin Impact* dance to *Conqueror* by IA.

### personalized name tents

At [SMU](https://beetlesite.netlify.app/professional/education/#singapore-management-university), we are all required to have our own name tents in order for the professors to mercilessly vaporize us by addressing us when we haven't studied the content (for legal reasons, that is a joke).
