## temporary bliss

I am a diehard fan of punk rock music or anything that fits this category. When I first heard this song, I was enraptured by the chorus. It's addictive and the whole song conveys such a harsh story. I really liked it... so much so that I spent 5 days hyperfocussing on my first ever A capella arrangement to produce this. I hope you like it.

## everything goes on

I first heard this song from the Star Guardian portion of League of Legends. To say it was moving would be an understatement. I couldn't (and still cannot) explain what in its harmonies was so hauntingly lilting. What followed was a three-day-caffeine-induced-hyperfocussed arrangement with 1 ukulele, 1 guitar, a five (or so) part harmony and the world's worst mixing. Everything does go on.

## prisoner of the air

I wrote this song when I was 18. When I first conceptualized it, I had actually planned to make it a song about attraction and romance, owing to the influence of the quantity of songs that touch the topic. As it evolved, it somehow became a meta-commentary on the freedom of speech from the perspective of a gentleman who realised that the system (whatever that implies) was working against them. Honestly, it doesn't even feel like I wrote it. But here it is.

## roses

This is one of my favourite songs. I composed something akin to an album when I was 18, and this was one of the ones which I really felt would speak to me in the future. Like a message from Squid to Beth, I know that it's something that I would have to learn from with my younger self.
