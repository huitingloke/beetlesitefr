## everything goes on

I first heard this song from the Star Guardian portion of League of Legends. To say it was moving would be an understatement. I couldn't (and still cannot) explain what in its harmonies was so hauntingly lilting. What followed was a three-day-caffeine-induced-hyperfocussed arrangement with 1 ukulele, 1 guitar, a five (or so) part harmony and the world's worst mixing. Everything does go on.
