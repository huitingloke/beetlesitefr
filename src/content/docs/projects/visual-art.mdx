## the cutesy style disclaimer

I have a very distinct style of doing projects -- I'll learn enough of the basics to form a style and then I'll stick to it for the rest of my life and keep improving on that one particular genre. This also applies to art. A lot of the people I draw have heads twice the size of the bodies and little beans for hands. Besides the clear advantage of not having to learn how to draw the human anatomy, this also allows me to make literally everything in life look adorable. At least, I think.
